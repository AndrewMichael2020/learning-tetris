# Play Control Improvements Summary

## New Toggle Functionality Added

### Play Once Button
- **Before**: Could only start games, button disabled during play
- **After**: 
  - Shows "Play Once" when idle → starts game
  - Shows "Stop" when playing → stops game and clears canvas
  - Always remain clickable for user control

### Play Multiple Button  
- **Before**: Could only start games, button disabled during play
- **After**:
  - Shows "Play Multiple" when idle → starts multiple episodes  
  - Shows "Stop" when playing → stops current episode sequence and clears canvas
  - Always remain clickable for user control

## Technical Implementation

### Functions Added:
1. `togglePlayOnce()` - Checks WebSocket state and calls start/stop accordingly
2. `stopPlayOnce()` - Closes WebSocket, resets UI, clears canvas
3. `togglePlayMultiple()` - Checks WebSocket state and calls start/stop accordingly  
4. `stopPlayMultiple()` - Closes WebSocket, resets UI, clears canvas

### UI State Management:
- Button text dynamically changes: "Play Once"↔"Stop", "Play Multiple"↔"Stop"
- Game status updates: "Playing..." → "Stopped" → "Completed"
- Canvas automatically clears when games are stopped
- Other buttons properly disabled/enabled during state transitions

### WebSocket Management:
- Clean connection closure when user stops games
- Proper cleanup of WebSocket references
- Error handling maintains consistent UI state
- Natural completion vs manual stop both handled correctly

## User Experience Improvements
✅ **Immediate Control**: Users can stop long-running games instantly  
✅ **Visual Feedback**: Clear button text shows current action available  
✅ **Clean Stops**: Canvas clears immediately, no residual game state  
✅ **Consistent Behavior**: Both Play Once and Play Multiple work identically  
✅ **No Freezing**: UI remains responsive during gameplay  

## Testing Verified
- ✅ Play Once: Start/Stop toggle working correctly
- ✅ Play Multiple: Start/Stop toggle working correctly  
- ✅ Canvas clearing on manual stop
- ✅ WebSocket cleanup (seen in server logs)
- ✅ Button text changes appropriately
- ✅ Game status updates correctly
- ✅ No UI freezing or button lockup

The implementation provides users full control over gameplay with immediate stop capability and clean UI state management.
